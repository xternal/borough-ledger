          Every pledge, ward and councillor has a feed. Copy a feed&rsquo;s address into a feed reader and it tells you when something changes: a pledge is
          budgeted or misses its deadline, a party replies, or a new month of payments arrives.

          A feed reader checks these addresses for you, a few times a day. Free ones include Feedly, Inoreader and NetNewsWire, and Outlook and Thunderbird can
          follow feeds too. You need no account here and give us no email address, and we cannot see who follows anything.
