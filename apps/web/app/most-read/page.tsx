        <ul>
          <li>
            Each time a reader opens one of the site&rsquo;s pages, that page&rsquo;s count for the day goes up by one. Days run midnight to midnight UTC;
            today&rsquo;s is still counting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Search engines and other crawlers, link previews, AI fetchers, scripts and pages a browser loads ahead of a click are not counted. Nor is any address
            that could hold something a reader typed, such as a postcode, or a link to the follow pages in our emails.
          </li>
          <li>
            The count keeps the page&rsquo;s address and the date, nothing else: no IP address, cookie, device, browser, country, referrer or time of day. It
            runs on our server, so there is no analytics script in your browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            The counts are kept by Upstash, which never sees anything about you. See the <a href="/privacy">privacy notice</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
