              You can ask for an email when a pledge changes. What you follow can reveal your political opinions, so we treat it as sensitive data and ask for your
              explicit consent first. We use your address only to send these alerts.

                which alerts we have sent you. Nothing else: no name, no IP address, no tracking in our emails.

                region. Neither may use it for anything else.
