/**
 * Page views (/most-read): one number per page per day, kept in Upstash Redis, and nothing about the reader. Ported
 * from LedgerGov.UK, with the same public format at /views.json.
 *
 * The proxy (proxy.ts) adds one to today's count for a page a reader opens, after the page is on its way, from the
 * request's path alone. It reads the user agent and the fetch headers only to skip crawlers, link previews, scripts
 * and prefetches, and stores neither: not the IP address, country, device, browser, referrer or time of day. Only the
 * site's own reading pages count. What a reader types (a postcode, a band, a capital value, a Balance it choice) never
 * reaches a page's path: it stays in the browser, goes in an API request's body, or rides in the query string, which is
 * never stored. Pages that carry a token (/follow/confirm, /follow/manage) are steps in a flow and never count. Without
 * the Upstash variables (a preview, a laptop) nothing is counted and /most-read says so.
 *
 * No "server-only" here: the proxy imports this file, and it holds nothing secret.
