# Pre-ship review

Self-review of the prototype and pack, 6 Oct 2026. Handing the pack to a developer or designer: fine now. Publishing: not before every blocker is closed.

## Blockers

| # | Issue | Fix | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Most numbers are test data: funding lines (except transitional relief), six of seven services, the waterfall (except the council tax line), all of balance-it, tax base, collection rate, all payments, all promises except free home care | ETL M1, M3, M4; CI blocks production while any test value renders | Data |
| B2 | Band D figures come from a third-party site (councildata.co.uk) | Re-source from the council's own council tax page or the government council tax table | Data |
| B3 | Free home care card dates (pledge 2014, charges scrapped 2015) are from memory | Editor sources both dates | Editor |
| B4 | Test promise cards use "Party A / Party B" with invented pledges and statuses | Never publish; replace with real manifesto cards | Editor |
| B5 | Looking official | Independent name, no council marks, disclaimer on every page; legal check on the name | Legal |
| B6 | Local election rules on third-party spending, and defamation risk for named councillors | Legal advice before launch and before May 2030 | Legal |
| B7 | Personal data in payments files | Redaction rules in docs/PRIVACY.md, tested on a full year of files before launch | Engineering |

## High

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | The committee paper lists business rates −£30.7m and grants +£13.2m for 2026/27; the prototype does not use them because the funding reform reshuffles several lines and I could not reconcile them from the summary | Rebuild the funding waterfall from the full report in M1 |
| H2 | "Council tax covers 36%" is computed from test funding totals | Recompute from sourced totals; it may move a lot |
| H3 | "Streets, waste, parks and transport £41.3m" is the net budget of one committee, which may not match the service grouping used elsewhere | Use one consistent classification (RO service lines) |
| H4 | GLA share shown as one line | Break down into police, fire, transport etc. from the GLA budget |
| H5 | Balance-it fee changes ignore behaviour (higher parking charges can reduce use) | Label as static; add a sourced elasticity later |
| H6 | No table view for charts | Add for flow, waterfall and bill split |
| H7 | Payments explorer shows 48 invented rows | Real files in M4 |

## Medium

* Labour 38 / Conservative 12 seats and leader from Wikipedia; confirm with the council site.
* Instalments assume 10 or 12 monthly payments; councils vary. Check H&F's default.
* Council Tax Support is mentioned in docs, not yet in the bill UI.
* Self-host Geist in production (Google Fonts sends visitor IPs to Google).

## Decide

* Name. "Borough Ledger" is a working title; make sure nothing suggests it is the council's.
* Whether to tell the council before launch. Recommended: yes, with an offer of right of reply on the data, without asking permission.
* Who funds it, and publishing that on the site.

## Status after M1 (6 Oct 2026)

| # | Status |
|---|---|
| B1 | Partly closed. Council tax, the 2026/27 budget (funding and services), reserves and their safe minimum, the tax base, the referendum rule and this year's gap waterfall are now sourced (`etl/`, `data/build/`, `data/manual/`). Next year's gap (£31.4m, Appendix B) and every named saving (Appendix C) are sourced too. Still test: the fees lever, three service toggle costs, pledge costs, all promises except free home care, all payments. `pnpm --filter @borough-ledger/schema report:test-values` lists them |
| B2 | Closed. Band D from the government council tax tables (Table 9 and Table 10, 2026/27); all eight bands match to the penny. The third-party figure for 2025/26 was 2p out |
| H1 | Closed. The waterfall is rebuilt from Table 2 of the budget report (PDF page 17), which closes to zero: business rates +£30.7m, grants −£13.2m, transitional relief −£6.0m, council tax −£7.7m, savings −£9.5m. No reserves were used in 2026/27 |
| H2 | Closed. Council tax covers 23% of day-to-day spending including schools, and 36% of the £255.3m the council funds itself |
| H3 | Closed. One classification: the government revenue account (RA) lines, grouped in `data/manual/ra_service_map.csv` |
| Medium: instalments | Open |
| Medium: Geist | Closed in M0 (self-hosted) |
| New: referendum 2027/28 | Government confirmed it will set no referendum principles for 2027-28 and 2028-29 for H&F and five other low council tax authorities (settlement consultation response, section 3). Balance-it no longer warns at 5% for 2027/28; marked approx until the 2027-28 principles report is laid |
| New: source version | The adopted budget is the Full Council report of 25 Feb 2026; figures match the Cabinet version of 9 Feb. Citations use the Full Council version and its page numbers |
| New: outturn 2024/25 | What was actually spent comes from the RS and RO5 outturn returns, in the same service groups (`history.outturn`). Housing and homelessness was budgeted at £11.9m and cost £30.8m, so the £44.4m 2025/26 budget reflects real temporary accommodation costs. Outturn includes grants received during the year, so a gap between budget and outturn is not by itself an overspend. Earlier outturn years need their own adapters |
| New: fees lever | Sourced from £80.5m of fees and charges income (Appendix I); approx and static (H5) |

## Status after M3 (7 Oct 2026)

| # | Status |
|---|---|
| B1 | Promises closed. 18 real cards from both parties' 2026 manifestos replace every test card. Still test: three service toggle costs (free home care, weekly bins, library hours) and all payments (M4) |
| B3 | Open. The free home care card now cites the 2026/27 budget report (PDF page 22) and both 2026 manifestos; the 2014 pledge and the 2015 end of charges are kept out of the timeline until an editor sources them |
| B4 | Closed. No "Party A / Party B" cards remain; CI fails if a promise card has quality "test" |
| New: card check | Every card is marked "Awaiting editor check" until two editors read each quote against the manifesto page (docs/PROMISE_STANDARD.md §6) |
| New: Conservative archive | The Conservative manifesto is saved with its SHA-256, but the Wayback Machine had not archived it by 7 Oct 2026. Submit it at web.archive.org/save and add `archive_url` to `content/parties.yaml` |
| Medium: seats | Closed. Labour 38 of 50 seats, the leader and every councillor now come from the council's ModernGov service (retrieved 7 Oct 2026), not Wikipedia |

## Status after M4 (7 Oct 2026)

| # | Status |
|---|---|
| B1 | Payments closed. The 48 invented payments are gone; the ledger is built from the council's own spend files (124,548 payments in 24 months so far). Only three service toggle costs remain test (free home care, weekly bins, library hours), so the production gate still blocks |
| B7 | Mostly closed. Redaction rules are in code and tested (docs/PRIVACY.md): council redactions, people the council did not redact, payments that usually go to individuals, and sole traders' own names. 19,700 rows are held back as council redactions and 256 more by our rules, shown only as totals. Run once on a full year: 2024/25 needs the Q3 and Q4 files, which the council's site serves only to a browser |
| H7 | Closed. Real files, reconciled: every month adds back up to its file to the penny, and the three older files with a total row match it |
| New: payments mapping | `data/manual/payments_service_map.csv` (500 lines) is a keyword draft. Until a person checks it, services in payments are marked approx. Largest lines first: an hour or two |
| New: missing quarters | Seven quarters listed by the council (Q3 2024/25 to Q1 2026/27) are not in the build yet. Download them by hand from the council's procurement and financial data page into `data/raw/payments/`, then run `--fetch`, `--draft-map` and a build |
| New: Companies House | Not matched yet. Supplier pages link to a Companies House search; a confident automatic match needs the free bulk company file (about 470 MB) or an API key, and is left for a later change |

## Payments update (7 Oct 2026)

All seven newer quarters the council lists are in (Q3 2024/25 to Q1 2026/27), downloaded through a browser from the council's page. The ledger has 241,195 payments in 45 months, up to June 2026, with 2024/25 and 2025/26 as complete years. 41,549 rows are held back as council redactions and 266 by our rules.

B7 closed: the redaction rules ran on two full years. Reviewing the names they let through found one private individual paid a fee ("first name and surname" with a first name the list did not know); the forename list now covers names common across London's communities, and that payment is a total only. Keep the review step (`etl/tests/test_payments.py` and a look at short names without an organisation word) each time new files are added.

## Public alpha (7 Oct 2026)

The project owner decided to publish the site as a public alpha at https://borough-ledger.vercel.app, open to search engines and AI crawlers, **before** the legal advice in B6 (third-party campaigning rules and naming councillors) and before the editor checks of the promise cards and the payments mapping. The site said "Alpha" next to its name until 23 October 2026, when Pavel asked to take it off the header and out of llms.txt; every promise card still says "Awaiting editor check", and payments mark service groups as approx.

To publish with no test values, the three "Balance it" switches without a sourced cost (free home care, weekly bins, library hours) are held back and named on the page as coming later. The two free home care cards no longer link to a switch until it returns. Production builds now pass the gate, which still blocks any test value from reaching them.

Still open before calling it a launch: B5 and B6 (legal), the editor checks, the human checks of the mapping tables, the Conservative manifesto archive link and B3.

## Payments mapping signed off (7 Oct 2026)

Claude checked all 642 lines of `data/manual/payments_service_map.csv` against what was bought and who was paid (40 groups corrected) and listed 26 lines it was unsure of; the project owner read those and signed off every line. Services in payments are now shown as sourced rather than approx. When new spend files add service areas, `--draft-map` adds them as `reviewed=no` and the site goes back to approx until they are checked.

## Manifesto archive and card check (7 Oct 2026)

- **Conservative manifesto archived.** The Wayback Machine copy of 26 March 2026, and a fresh one made today, are byte-identical (same SHA-256) to the file the cards quote; a May capture was cut off at 5 MB and is not used. Both parties' manifestos now have an archived copy. Closes the "Conservative archive" item.
- **Editor check prepared.** `docs/editor-checks/2026-manifesto-cards.md` sets each of the 18 quotes against its manifesto page (all 18 are on the cited page word for word; Labour's parks pledge runs across two columns on page 5 and is also in the page 2 list), with each status and its reason, and two leads from the spend files. docs/PROMISE_STANDARD.md asks for two editors per card before the "Awaiting editor check" mark comes off.

## Legal check done (7 Oct 2026)

The project owner reports that the legal check is done with no issues: B5 (the name and not looking official) and B6 (third-party campaigning rules and naming councillors). B6 says to take advice again before the May 2030 election period.

Still open before calling it a launch:

- **Editor check of the 18 promise cards** by two editors (docs/editor-checks/2026-manifesto-cards.md).
- **B3**: the free home care history before 2026 (not shown on the card until sourced).
- **Decide**: the final name, whether to tell the council before launch (recommended: yes, offering a right of reply on the data), and saying on the site who funds it (now: the owner, with a Ko-fi link).
- **Search Console**: the verification code goes in NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION on Vercel.

## Budget mapping signed off (8 Oct 2026)

The project owner signed off every budget mapping table after Claude's pre-check (PR #18): ra_service_map, service_groups, funding_map, rs_outturn_map, funding_groups, payment_groups and the toggle cost in toggles_2027-28. Every hand-made table in data/manual/ now has its human check. The five small differences between the budget's government grouping and the payments ledger's team grouping (climate change costs, Supporting People, housing benefit administration, the coroner's court and the London levies) stay as they are.

## Cards signed off, contact address, open repository (8 Oct 2026)

- **Promise cards signed off.** The project owner and The Robot signed off all 18 cards against docs/editor-checks/2026-manifesto-cards.md, and the "Awaiting editor check" mark is off every card. The free home care card keeps its note about the history before 2026 (B3).
- **Contact address.** Every footer, every promise card's right of reply, the FAQ and llms.txt now give boroughs@guzh.uk for corrections and replies (docs/PRIVACY.md, "Replies and corrections by email").
- **Repository public.** GitHub stopped running Actions on the private repository on 8 Oct (billing). The project owner made it public, which makes Actions free. Before that the whole history was checked: no keys, tokens or key files, and no person's name in any earlier payments build. Commits so far carry the owner's own email address as author, as GitHub shows for any public repository.

Still open before calling it a launch:

- **B3**: the free home care history before 2026.
- **Decide**: the final name (and with it a domain), whether to tell the council before launch (recommended: yes, offering a right of reply on the data), and a licence for the code and data now the repository is public.
- **Search Console**: the verification code goes in NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION on Vercel.

## Status after M6, ward view (8 Oct 2026)

- **Your ward** is a new menu item and a section on the home page. Readers find their ward by postcode (looked up in their own browser at postcodes.io, docs/PRIVACY.md) or on a map drawn from the ONS boundaries, and land on a page for the ward: its councillors and their posts, pledges about the ward, the wards next to it, where to report street problems (FixMyStreet, linked only) and a reminder that council tax is the same in every ward.
- `/councillors` became `/wards`, with a permanent redirect so old links keep working.
- **Not yet:** council building schemes by ward. The spend files name places in about 200 capital projects ("Frank Banfield Park", "Edward Woods Fire Safety works"), but matching each to a ward needs a hand-checked table, like the payments mapping. Planned as the next change, shown as approx until checked.
- No pledge card is about one ward yet. Ward pages say so and ask for ward leaflets at the contact address.

## Building schemes by ward (8 Oct 2026)

Each ward page now shows the building work the council's spend files say it paid for there, from January 2024 to June 2026: £346.8m across 308 schemes. £251.6m is placed in one ward, £18.9m on roads and blocks across wards (shown on each, not split), £44.0m on programmes everywhere (footways, street lights, void repairs) and £32.3m on schemes whose name gives no place. Hammersmith Broadway has the most, £85.6m, mostly the Town Hall.

The ward for each scheme is ours, from its name (`data/manual/capital_scheme_wards.csv`). Claude checked all 308 lines: OpenStreetMap matches against the name and the nearest postcodes, roads by their whole length; several were moved (Olympia is in Avonmore, Normand Park in Lillie). Six lines are left for the project owner (Lillie Road and Farm Lane housing sites, which Queensmill school, Normand Croft school, North Kensington Gate). Until every line is signed off, the ward figures are marked approx.

Update, 8 Oct 2026: the project owner asked Claude to settle the six open lines with its best judgement rather than check them. Claude found each site in the council's own project pages (Lillie Road: 42 homes at 70-80 Lillie Road, West Kensington; Farm Lane: 31 homes at 11 Farm Lane, Walham Green), the DfE school register (Queensmill is now only at 1 Askham Road, Wormholt; Normand Croft is W14 9PA, West Kensington) and OPDC planning records (North Kensington Gate, Scrubs Lane, College Park and Old Oak). Every line is now checked by Claude, but no person has checked the table, so the ward figures stay marked approx until someone does.

## M5, first part: follow by RSS (8 Oct 2026)

Every pledge, ward and councillor has an RSS feed, plus feeds for everything, every pledge and payments (92 feeds, all static files built with the site). Pledge items are new cards, each dated event and replies; ward feeds add each month's building work in the ward (marked as our estimate of the ward); the payments feed has one item a month. `/follow` explains RSS in plain words and lists the main feeds; pages link their own feed and declare it in the page head. No accounts, no email, nothing stored. Still to do in M5: email alerts (needs a small database and double opt-in) and the contribute form.

Ward schemes signed off (8 Oct 2026): the project owner signed off `data/manual/capital_scheme_wards.csv`. Ward building figures are now marked sourced. Every hand-made table in `data/manual/` has its human check.

## Name and domain (8 Oct 2026)

The project owner chose the name **Borough Book** and the domain **boroughbook.uk** (DNS at Cloudflare, served by Vercel; www redirects to the bare domain). It is general on purpose: later boroughs get their own section on the same site. The old address, borough-ledger.vercel.app, redirects every page to the same page on boroughbook.uk, so links, search ranking and RSS subscriptions carry over. The legal check covered the old name; the owner may want the same quick check of the new one. Code packages (`@borough-ledger/*`), the repo, the Vercel project and RSS item ids keep the old name, which readers never see.

Still to do: verify boroughbook.uk in Google Search Console as a Domain property (one DNS TXT record).

## M7, council decisions (8 Oct 2026)

`/decisions` lists every Cabinet and Full Council decision since January 2026 (45 at 11 meetings), from the council's own records, with a feed. Each day a workflow fetches new decisions and asks Claude which open pledges of the party running the council each one moves, quoting the decision word for word; the suggestions arrive as a pull request, and merging it confirms them and adds the events to the cards. The first 45 decisions were read by Claude in a session: three links are suggested (green schemes in a council plan, Jan 2026; the Pathway Bond being delivered, Jan 2026; affordable homes on the Avonmore site in a council plan, Sep 2026), in their own pull request for the owner to confirm. Pledge cards now show each timeline event's source and their Follow and Send evidence buttons work. Needs an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repository secret for the daily suggestions; without it, decisions are still fetched daily.

## Search and AI search (8 Oct 2026)

- **Pledge pages answer the question.** The pledge is the page's `<h1>` (it was an `<h3>`), the title carries its status ("Labour pledge: ... (In plan)"), and each page has an "In short" paragraph and five questions answered from the card, the same way for every party. Structured data: an Article about the quotation (dates, author, sources, the status in words; not a fact-check rating), an FAQPage and breadcrumbs.
- **For AI tools:** every pledge as Markdown at `/promise/<id>.md` (canonical back to the page by HTTP header), `/llms-full.txt` with the whole site in one file (figures with sources and estimates marked), and `/llms.txt` pointing to both.
- **Crawlers:** robots.txt names the AI search crawlers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, Google, Apple, Microsoft, DuckDuckGo, Mistral, Meta, Common Crawl); pages allow full snippets and large image previews; the sitemap gives a last-changed date wherever one is known; an Organization record and an icon on every page.
- **IndexNow:** after each production deploy, `.github/workflows/indexnow.yml` sends the pages that changed to IndexNow (Bing, which feeds ChatGPT search and Copilot, plus Yandex and others). The key file is `/cd99e6aa5d02a98cce4df8abc80445fb.txt`, public by design.
- Still to do by the owner: Google Search Console (Domain property) and Bing Webmaster Tools.

## Party and topic pages (8 Oct 2026)

`/party/<id>` (one per party with pledges) and `/topic/<slug>` (one per pledge topic, 10 so far) answer searches like "Labour Hammersmith manifesto pledges" or "Hammersmith parks". Each opens with where the pledges stand, lists them, shows the council decisions that moved them and answers a few questions, with structured data (CollectionPage, FAQPage, breadcrumbs) and its own feed. Topic pages show the council's budget for the topic only where a budget line honestly matches (six by name, community safety by hand); health, young people and jobs, and climate show none, because the matching budget would mislead (the hospital pledge is about the NHS). Every pledge card links its party and topic.

## Quality pass (8 Oct 2026)

- **Accessibility 100** (Lighthouse) on home, promises, a pledge, a party, decisions and payments, up from 91 to 96. Text colours darkened to pass WCAG AA (4.5:1) on every background they sit on: faint grey #6b6b74, red #b91c1c, amber #92400e, and darker ink for status pills. In dark mode the faint grey is #8291a0 rather than the navy palette's #7d8b99, which falls to 4.45:1 on raised surfaces. Links that sit side by side on /decisions and in the payments file table have room to tap. Performance 95 to 100, best practices and SEO 100 on every page audited.
- **Share images** for party and topic pages (status counts only, never money).
- **Uptime:** `.github/workflows/uptime.yml` checks the main pages, their content and the old address's redirect every 30 minutes; a failed run emails the owner.
- **Reminders:** `.github/workflows/reminders.yml` runs `scripts/reminders.py` every morning, which opens an issue on the day each job falls due: the council's new spend file (1 Feb, May, Aug and Nov), the new budget (4 March, after Full Council), the yearly government data (council tax on 1 April, budget returns on 1 August, care figures on 1 December and 1 February), the quarterly pledge audit, the council's new deadlines (1 June), next year's budget cycle (15 October), the domain's renewal (1 September), Node 24 (1 April 2027), legal advice before the 2030 election period (1 December 2029), and a week after each council's election in `data/config/boroughs.json`.
- **CI pinned to Ubuntu 24.04**, so GitHub moving `ubuntu-latest` to Ubuntu 26 (from 19 Oct 2026) cannot break a build unannounced; move up on purpose later.

## Weekly digest (8 Oct 2026)

Every Sunday evening (18:00 BST, 17:00 GMT; Fridays until 9 Oct 2026) `.github/workflows/weekly-digest.yml` opens an issue with a draft Substack post for Monday: the week's council decisions and any pledges they moved, replies, missed deadlines, new spend data, Cabinet and Full Council meetings in the next fortnight with their agendas (from the council's ModernGov service), pledge deadlines in the next 60 days, and a "number of the week" (building work in one ward, a different ward each week). Claude writes it in the owner's voice from those facts only; code rejects any draft with a number that is not one of the facts' numbers and falls back to a plain version. The facts are listed under the draft so it can be checked in a minute.

## Phase 1: tables, the Mayor's share, election results, home care history (8 Oct 2026)

- **B3 closed.** The free home care card now carries its history from primary sources, read in full: the 2014 Labour manifesto ("we will abolish home care charges", then £12 an hour; PDF page 18), Cabinet's approval on 2 February 2015 (the report gives £441,000 a year of income given up), the Full Council vote of 25 February 2015 (25 to 0, 15 not voting; the net £324,000 a year met from savings elsewhere) and the end of charges on 1 April 2015 (Full Council report, 17 October 2024). The events were appended; the card shows them by date, and feed items keep their identifiers. The Cabinet report names the budget meeting as 26 February; the council's meeting list and minutes give 25 February, which the card uses.
- **Table view for every chart.** The budget flow, the gap and the bill each have "Show as a table" under them: plain HTML tables with captions and row headers, rendered on the server, folded away by default. On a phone the budget flow is already a list, so its table is on wider screens only.
- **The Mayor of London's share by body.** Police £334.13, fire brigade £76.85, transport £77.09 and City Hall and the London Assembly £22.44 at Band D, from the Mayor's own decision (MD3472), with this year's rise (£15.00 more for police, £5.13 for the fire brigade). Any band and the single person discount split the same way, in whole pence that add back up to the Mayor's share. Shown as approx until the owner signs off `data/manual/gla_2026-27.csv`.
- **Ward election results.** Each ward page shows how it voted on 7 May 2026: seats, turnout, every candidate's party and votes, and who was elected, from Democracy Club (CC BY-SA 4.0) with a link to the council's declaration. Only councillors are named (invariant 6); every party is shown by its registered name the same way (invariant 7). Each councillor's page gives their own vote. Two wards were checked against the council's own pages; the build checks every ward has a result, the winners had the most votes and each is a councillor of that ward.

## Phase 2: suppliers on the companies register (8 Oct 2026)

- **Closes "New: Companies House".** 2,738 of the 3,408 companies and charities in the spend files now link to their entry on the companies register, from Companies House's free bulk file of live companies (no account, no API key): 2,577 by their exact name, 139 by a name they had while the council paid them, and 22 checked by hand. Supplier pages show the registered name and number (linked to Companies House), status (in liquidation and in administration are highlighted; 65 such), type, date formed, the company's own description of its business, and the local authority area of its registered office (150 are in Hammersmith & Fulham). Unmatched suppliers keep a Companies House search link and say why they may not match.
- **Certain, or checked.** Live company names are unique, so an exact name match is certain unless the name passed between companies: a company formed after the council last paid that name is refused (39), one renamed away from the name before the first payment is refused (42), and one formed during the payments is not linked automatically (14, all rejected on review, since part of the money predates the company). Matches on the name without its suffix (31) were decided one by one in `data/manual/companies_house_matches.csv`.
- **No people, no addresses.** Only register facts about the company are kept; the registered office is reduced to its local authority area and the postcode is dropped (docs/PRIVACY.md). Suppliers that could be a person are never matched. CI refuses any other field.
- **Refresh:** the quarterly spend-file reminder now includes downloading the month's Companies House file and re-running the match.

## Phase 2: the building programme and council homes (9 Oct 2026)

- **/building** shows the council's four-year building programme (£135.0m, 2026/27 to 2029/30) by area, with every scheme folded underneath in residents' words (the council's name in a tooltip), how it is paid for (£75.4m borrowed), the debt for building work (falling from £375.8m to £356.5m), the schemes that are what a manifesto pledge names (Avonmore, green investment, parks, CCTV; any party's pledge is linked the same way), and a table of every scheme year by year.
- **/council-homes** shows the ring-fenced council homes account: where the £113.0m of rent and service charges goes in 2026/27 and how much of every £1 (37p on interest and wear and tear, 24p running the service, 22p repairs), the 4.8% rent rise, council rents against private rents (£136.50 against at least £476 a week for one bedroom), the £317.2m of building work on council homes, the reserve (£5.9m, about 3 weeks of rent) and the ten-year plan (198 new homes; borrowing per home from £49,100 to £72,500).
- **What does not add up in the council's papers, said openly:** the resolution approves £135.5m and £318.8m, but the report's own tables add up to £135.0m and £317.2m; one funding total is misprinted as a dash. Both are shown on /building.
- **Checks:** `etl/capital.py --check` in CI (every printed total, with rounding allowed; the account balances); a unit test proves a wrong figure, an undeclared misprint and an unbalanced account each stop the build. Every non-zero figure was matched against the report's text. Figures show as approx until the owner signs off both tables (`data/manual/README.md`).
- Both pages sit under "Budget" in the menu, which is highlighted on them; the home page's budget section links to both; sitemap, llms.txt and llms-full.txt include them.

## Phase 3: Kensington and Chelsea (9 Oct 2026, in review)

- **/kensington-and-chelsea**: the bill by band with the Mayor of London's split, the £378m day-to-day budget by service and funding (balanced, with the same checks), council tax over five years, and all 50 councillors in 18 wards with each ward's May 2026 result (Conservative 34, Labour 13, Liberal Democrats 3). Its own menu highlights the section in view. Pledges, payments, decisions and the gap come later from the council's own papers (docs/BOROUGHS.md).
- **Hammersmith & Fulham unchanged:** the shared build step and the shared page model were moved out of Hammersmith & Fulham's code with its build checked byte for byte and all its tests passing.
- **Found and fixed:** payments in lieu for armed forces homes in the tax base; housing benefit's remainder; a band lookup that searched for "Hammersmith".
- **Decision for the owner:** moving Hammersmith & Fulham's addresses under `/hammersmith-and-fulham` (plan item 12); not done (docs/BOROUGHS.md).

## First screen, borough selector and postcode finder (9 Oct 2026)

- **First screen:** the separate "Independent project" row and its spacing are gone. The first line now holds the borough selector and the independence note together ("Independent. Not run by or affiliated with ..."), which still appears on every page (invariant 5); the hero's top padding went from 52px to 28px and the gap under the figures row from 72px to 48px.
- **Borough selector:** a chip at the top of each borough's page listing every borough on the site, the current one marked (`aria-current`), as a plain disclosure of links that works without JavaScript; Escape or a click outside closes it.
- **Postcode finder on the first screen** of every borough's page, for every borough on the site: a Hammersmith & Fulham postcode opens its ward page, a Kensington and Chelsea one its ward on the borough page (highlighted), and any other says which borough it is in and which boroughs are covered. The finder on /wards and the home page's ward section use the same lookup. The ward lists come from a small bundled file (`data/build/boroughs/finder.json`, written and checked by `etl/borough_people.py`), so pages rendered on request read no files.
- Accessibility 100 on /, /kensington-and-chelsea and /wards (Lighthouse), with no experimental check failing.

## 15 more boroughs (9 Oct 2026, in review)

Barking and Dagenham, Brent, Bromley, Camden, Hackney, Haringey, Harrow, Havering, Hounslow, Merton, Redbridge, Richmond upon Thames, Southwark, Sutton and Tower Hamlets join Kensington and Chelsea: bill, budget, council tax history, every councillor and ward result, the postcode finder and the borough selector, all from the same checked pipeline. Elected mayors (Hackney, Tower Hamlets), seats that changed hands since May, names written differently and missing turnout are handled without guessing (docs/BOROUGHS.md). Lambeth waits for its ModernGov service to answer.

## Lambeth (9 Oct 2026)

Lambeth joins: its councillor service answers, slowly (about 100 seconds), and lists an empty seat as "Vacancy", now read as an empty seat. 18 London boroughs on the site.

## Manchester and Birmingham (9 Oct 2026, in review)

The first councils outside London: Manchester City Council and Birmingham City Council, with their bills split into police, fire and the combined authority from the government's own tables (checked to the penny against the area Band D, this year and last), Birmingham's parish precepts shown apart, Manchester's elections by thirds and Birmingham's councillors from May's ballots (docs/BOROUGHS.md). 20 councils on the site.

## Leeds (9 Oct 2026, in review)

Leeds City Council's bill (police set by the Mayor of West Yorkshire, fire, 31 parishes shown apart), budget and five years of council tax, from the same returns and checks. No councillors yet: Leeds' democracy site turns automated requests away, and the page says so and links the council's own list (docs/BOROUGHS.md). The rounding allowance in one Table 10 check now scales with the council's size. 21 councils on the site.

## Seven more London boroughs (9 Oct 2026, in review)

Croydon, Ealing, Kingston upon Thames, Lewisham, Newham, Wandsworth and Westminster: 28 councils on the site. The council tax agreement check allows £5,000 (these differ by £1,200 to £3,100); a May winner can be shown as no longer on the council's list only where the ward held a by-election since May (docs/BOROUGHS.md).

## Glasgow (9 Oct 2026, in review)

The first Scottish council: Scotland's own returns, rules and Scottish Water's charges, with the same standard of checks (docs/BOROUGHS.md). For the owner: check `data/manual/scottish_water.csv` against the two leaflets once (it shows as approx until then), and the grouping in `data/manual/scot_service_groups.csv`. 29 councils on the site.

## Islington, Bexley and Waltham Forest (9 Oct 2026, in review)

Three London boroughs whose two returns differ on council tax by £23,227 to £305,538, published by the owner's decision with both figures shown on the page (docs/BOROUGHS.md). 32 councils on the site.

## Edinburgh, Highland and North Yorkshire (9 Oct 2026, in review)

Two more Scottish councils and North Yorkshire (docs/BOROUGHS.md); a "Counties and regions" heading in the picker; parished councils' history now outside a parish, as their bills. 35 councils.

## Cardiff (9 Oct 2026, in review)

The first Welsh council: Band I, the fire levy shown as its own calculated line, community councils as a total, councillors from 2022 with by-elections accounted for (docs/BOROUGHS.md). For the owner: check `data/manual/wales_service_groups.csv`, and the six community councils' names against Cardiff's council tax resolution of 5 March 2026 once. 36 councils.

## Belfast (9 Oct 2026, in review)

The first council in Northern Ireland: rates from a home's capital value instead of bands, the budget by committee, councillors by district electoral area (docs/BOROUGHS.md). For the owner: look once at `data/manual/ni_poundages.csv` (against the Department of Finance's page), `ni_rate_statistics.csv` (against the four circulars, pages 1 to 4) and `belfast_budget.csv` (against page 3 of the committee minutes), and mark each row "yes": until then every Belfast figure shows as approx. 37 councils. Checked by the owner against the sources and marked "yes" (10 October 2026): every figure is now sourced except the growth fund, which is the difference (approx), and bills on a given value, which are our arithmetic (modelled).

## Pledge finder (13 Oct 2026)

Every two weeks a scheduled task on the owner's computer (`bb-pledge-finder`), the AI Journalist (Claude), looks for new pledges in the same places for every party and drafts cards marked "Awaiting editor check" in a pull request it never merges (docs/PLEDGE_FINDER.md, docs/PROMISE_STANDARD.md section 7). It also works through each manifesto in page order, two pledges per party per run. CI now reads the source of every new quote and fails unless the words are there word for word on the cited page (`promises:quotes`; checked against all 18 published cards, which pass). The site's wording no longer says "headline pledges" only, and the promises page says an AI journalist looks for new pledges and the editor checks each one. Until a second person joins, the two editors are the owner and the AI Journalist. It runs on the Mac, not as a cloud routine, because the cloud environment could reach only GitHub, npm and PyPI on 13 October 2026 (docs/PLEDGE_FINDER.md).

## A page for each section (17 Oct 2026)

The owner asked for real addresses instead of anchors, and for the promises always to be one click away. Your bill, Budget, The gap, Balance it and Method now have pages of their own (`/bill`, `/budget`, `/gap`, `/balance`, `/method`), and the menu, every internal link, the sitemap, llms.txt and the breadcrumbs use them. The home page stays the long overview, so old `/#bill` links still work, and each of its section headings links to the section's own page. The menu highlights the page you are on, and nothing on the home page. A pledge's "see next year with it" opens `/balance?promise=<id>`; no card links to a switch at the moment (see "Public alpha" above), so nobody sees that button until one does. The filters on `/promises` (party, status or overdue, topic) are read from the address on the server, so a filtered link opens filtered.

## One editor approves (17 Oct 2026)

The project owner decided, for all his projects (about 23:00 BST): "for all projects now we have only ME, so make my approval the only needed from now, and also the AI Editor as a checker to mention". One editor's approval, Pavel Guzhikov's, now publishes a card. The AI Journalist (Claude, an AI; Pavel wrote "the AI Editor", and nothing is renamed) checks each quote word for word first and never approves. This replaces "two editors" in the sections of 7, 8 and 13 October above: the two were the owner and the AI Journalist, and the AI Journalist is now the checker, not an editor. An approved card says both, "Checked by the AI Journalist and approved by Pavel Guzhikov", on its page and in its Markdown (`packages/schema/src/editorial.ts`); a card waiting for the editor still reads "Awaiting editor check". Sign-offs already given stay valid, and docs/editor-checks/ is unchanged.

## Also by the author (19 Oct 2026)

Also by the author (Pavel, 19 Oct 2026, about 14:50 BST): «Ruminator как рекомендовано»: one plain footer link, no card, no top line. He was replying to the recommendation on where to mention his other project, Ruminator.xyz: for BoroughBook.UK, at most one modest footer link. Every footer now ends its credit line with "Also by the author: Ruminator.xyz", in the footer's own link style, linking to https://ruminator.xyz/ with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, no query string and nothing counted. It is the same link on every page, never chosen per page, party or promise (`ALSO_BY` in `apps/web/lib/site.ts`, tested in `apps/web/test/footer.test.ts`).

## Promises close to the way in (19 Oct 2026)

Pavel decided on Monday 19 October 2026, at about 14:54 BST: «UX как рекомендовано». He was replying to the OpenPromises engine session's recommendation to bring the promises close to the way in; it is recorded as OpenPromises decision 30, and the same approach applies on all three of his sites. The home page now has a promises block second, straight after its opening and before the bill: "26 promises tracked", linking to `/promises`, with the count at each status in the site's own words; "Latest changes", the 3 cards that changed last; "Due next", up to 3 open cards with the nearest deadline from today on, never one already in the latest changes; and "All promises →". Each item is one link to its card, showing the party, the pledge in its own words, its status and a date, and ends "Open the promise →", hidden from screen readers because the whole item is the link. The opening has one more line, "26 promises tracked →", to `/promises`. Nothing is drawn when no card is published.

Each promise opens its card in one click. The home page's own Promises section dropped its select-then-open side pane, which kept the page simpler: every row there, on `/promises` and on the party and topic pages is a link to its card ending "Open the promise →", and the card page shows everything the pane did. "Promises" is in every menu: another council's page, a Northern Ireland rates page and the council tax decoder end their menus with it, leading to Hammersmith & Fulham's promises, and a screen reader hears "Promises in Hammersmith & Fulham".

The cards are picked by a rule, never by hand: the engine's `spotlight()`, written here because this site does not run the engine (`apps/web/lib/spotlight.ts`). A card last changed on the latest of its timeline event dates, version dates and reply dates that are not after today. "Latest changes" are the published cards by that date, newest first, then by id. "Due next" are the published cards not already listed, with an open status (anything but delivered, failed, quietly dropped or unscoreable, so an opposition pledge counts as open), whose deadline is today or later, nearest first, then by id. Today is the UK date the home page is built; it rebuilds daily. Published means the editor has approved the card: a card awaiting the editor's check is counted in the total, as on `/promises`, but never picked. The rule reads nothing about who made a promise, and the tests swap and remove every card's party and get the same picks (`apps/web/test/spotlight.test.ts`). On 19 October it picks, as latest changes, `con-2026-service-standards`, `con-2026-special-constables` and `lab-2026-council-tax-support` (each last changed on 14 October, so in order of id); nothing is due next, because no card has a deadline yet, and the block says so.

## AI Journalist backtest fixes (19 Oct 2026)

Pavel, Monday 19 October 2026, 15:59 BST: «чини бэктест как рекомендовано» ("fix the backtest as recommended"). It acts on the OpenPromises session's backtest of AI Journalist over the three sites' git history, run the same day.

**What the backtest found.** Replaying the AI Journalist's work over the repository's history: 8 pledge cards drafted, 4 approved by the editor (the run of 14 October, #89, approved in #90) and 4 waiting for him (the run by hand of 18 October, #95). The cards were sound; the process had two faults.

1. **The daily decisions job failed silently from 14 October.** claude-opus-5-5 refuses a forced tool call ("tool_choice: type "tool" and "any" are not supported for this model.", a 400), so the morning runs of 14, 15 and 16 October failed at "Ask Claude which pledges new decisions move". The only trace was a red run in the Actions tab. Commit da28939 (#93, 16 October) asked for structured outputs instead, and every run since has passed (6 decisions assessed on 16 October, none new since), but nothing told anyone in between.
2. **A run by hand moved the pledge finder's schedule.** The due check counted any "New pledges" pull request, so the run by hand of 18 October (#95) made 26 October a skip and pushed the next scheduled run out to 2 November. That run also used a Claude session's branch, not a `pledges-<date>` branch.

**What changed.**

- **A failed job opens an issue.** The two scheduled jobs that ask Claude (`.github/workflows/daily-decisions.yml` and `weekly-digest.yml`) end with a `report-failure` job. When a run fails, `scripts/job_failed.py` opens an issue labelled `job-failed` ("Job failed: <workflow>"), or comments on the one already open, with the run link, the failed step and the error from its log; GitHub emails the owner about both. A probe of the decisions job does not report. Tests in `etl/tests/test_job_failed.py`: the log of 14 October gives the 400 as the error, a first failure opens a labelled issue and a later one comments, and every scheduled workflow that uses the Claude API has the job.
- **The request shape is tested.** The decisions request is built in one place (`suggestRequest`, `packages/schema/src/decision-links.ts`) and checked by `requestProblems` (`packages/schema/src/claude-request.ts`) against what the API refuses: a forced tool call, thinking turned off or given a budget, sampling parameters, a prefilled answer, the old `output_format`, schema keywords structured outputs do not take, and a fallback without its beta header. The suggester does not send a request that fails the check. `claude-request.test.ts` shows the request passes, that the one which failed in October is caught, and that no code in the repository forces a tool call (the scan finds the code before da28939). The current shape is valid: structured outputs (`output_config.format`), no `tool_choice`, `max_tokens` 16000 to leave room for thinking, and `fallbacks: "default"` with the `server-side-fallback-2026-07-01` header. The probe and every run since 16 October passed with it.
- **Only scheduled runs set the schedule.** `python3 scripts/pledge_finder.py due` replaces the shell check in docs/PLEDGE_FINDER.md, section 0: a run is due when no scheduled run has opened a "New pledges" pull request in the last 10 days. Each pull request's first line says which kind of run opened it, with a hidden marker the check reads. Runs by hand, and every pull request from before the marker, count only for where the next run looks back to. The schedule started with #89 on 14 October (`SCHEDULE_STARTED`), so 26 October runs and 2 November skips, as planned before #95. `start --scheduled` or `start --by-hand` makes the run's branch, `pledges-<date>` off `origin/main` (`-2` if that name is taken), for a run by hand too. Tests in `etl/tests/test_pledge_finder.py`. The scheduled task `bb-pledge-finder` follows docs/PLEDGE_FINDER.md, so it uses the new check once this is on `main`.

## One weekly desk for every ledger (20 Oct 2026)

Pavel asked whether one routine every Sunday should do the background work for all his ledgers: new promises, a check on the promises already published, new emergencies (RussiaLedger.com), and any other data to check, add or confirm. He took the recommendation: "go, follow your recos".

**What changed.** One scheduled task on Pavel's Mac, the weekly ledger desk, works through LedgerGov.UK, RussiaLedger.com, BoroughBook.UK, UkraineLedger.com and USLedger.org every Sunday at 20:00 UK time, one at a time, each by its own `docs/desk/WEEKLY.md`, and sends one report, or nothing when there is nothing new. Here it runs the pledge finder (still every other week, by `pledge_finder.py due`: 25 October 2026 runs, 1 November skips) in place of the Monday task `bb-pledge-finder`, now paused, and adds three checks: the cards whose deadline was missed a month ago, for the editor to confirm (PROMISE_STANDARD §3), broken links, and the health of the site's jobs and pull requests. A scheduled pull request's first line now names the weekly ledger desk. `pledge-finder-watch.yml` still runs `due` every Tuesday, so a Sunday run that opened nothing is caught as before.

**Why the Mac.** The pledge finder needs the app's built-in browser for the council's site and the parties' pages, and RussiaLedger.com needs archive copies the cloud cannot reach, so one task for every ledger runs where every source can be read. The FOI check (`bb-foi-answers`, Mondays until the three answers are handled) stays a task of its own.

## A short menu and a first screen of cards (23 Oct 2026)

Pavel, on LedgerGov.UK's menu on 23 October 2026: "it is soooo big.. too big?", then "maybe we should rethink first screen? have a glance of Main Thing we have here: key number(s), promises block, play sandbox ledger with gov money. i want a person to understand both The Scale of our Data and the Easiness he now has", "and a logbook of last changes/additions/check down is a good idea", and "we can have a switcher somewhere to easy-go on sister sites and guzh.uk and ruminator.xyz". He chose option A of the sketches (https://claude.ai/artifact/CoD6wVe8TE26xAqCF4HPpW), "but i'd some more widget cards there and give Header less vertical pixels". Once it was live on LedgerGov.UK (ledgergov.uk #167 and #168) he asked for "the same great job for boroughbook and russialedger".

**Done:**

- **The menu** has five pages: Your bill, Budget, Promises, Your ward, Method (`MENU` in `apps/web/lib/nav.ts`). The gap, Balance it and Payments are parts of Budget: on their pages, and on building work, council homes and supplier pages, Budget is highlighted, and tabs under the top bar (`BudgetTabs`) say which part you are on. Follow is a button beside the menu. The top bar is one row, 48px (it was 56px). Other councils' pages keep their own menus, which are parts of their one long page, ending with Promises.
- **The family switcher** beside the logo (`components/FamilySwitcher.tsx`, a `<details>` that opens without JavaScript): LedgerGov.UK, BoroughBook.UK (marked "you are here"), USLedger.org, RussiaLedger.com, UkraineLedger.com and Ruminator.xyz, each with one line, and "Made by Pavel Guzhikov, guzh.uk" (a comma, not a middle dot: invariant 10). This is a second place that names Ruminator.xyz, besides the footer's "Also by the author"; Pavel asked for it.
- **The first screen** (`components/HomeFirstScreen.tsx`), in place of the opening:
  - a one-line headline from the budget and the cards ("Where £398m of council money goes in Hammersmith & Fulham, and 26 promises to watch");
  - the year's six figures (the figures row the opening had);
  - the promises at a glance: the count, a bar by status and the counts;
  - Balance it: next year's council tax rise at the two settings the tool itself marks (a freeze and the rise the forecast assumes), with what is still to find. It shares the reader's choices with the full tool further down, and "Open Balance it" carries them to `/balance`;
  - the postcode finder and borough picker, with the independence note, in a card;
  - four promises to watch: the latest delivered, the latest not met, the open one due next and the latest step forward. A rule that finds nothing says so ("No pledge has been delivered yet");
  - the logbook: what was added, moved, reworded or checked, newest first, six lines.
- **The rules** (`apps/web/lib/home.ts`), never chosen by hand, published cards only, reading nothing about who made a pledge (tested by swapping every card's party):
  - a card counts as added on the day its first wording was recorded, and one party's cards added on one day are one line ("Labour: 2 new pledges");
  - each status step, rewording and reply is a line;
  - the council decisions put to the pledge check on one day are one line ("6 council decisions checked against every pledge: none moves one", from `data/build/decision_assessments.json`).
- **Nothing left the home page**: every section is still on it, after the first screen, so old `/#bill` links still work. The promises block (decision 30) comes straight after the first screen.
- **Two tests encoded the old layout**, and both now follow the new one: "N promises tracked →" in the opening is now the heading of the first screen's promise card, after the figures; and the promises block comes after the first screen rather than after the opening.

**Deliberately not done:** the editor's approvals are not in the logbook yet. They are recorded only in docs/editor-checks/, not in the data, so the logbook cannot date them by a rule. The payments months are not in it either, because the data does not say when each month was added.
